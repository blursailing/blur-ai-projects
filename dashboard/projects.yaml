  title: Ensemble Route Divergence Alerting
  category: best-practice
  edge: 8.5
  complexity: 4
  status: planned
  description: >
    Run Expedition's ensemble routing across all loaded models, then analyze
    where routes converge (safe) vs diverge (critical). Flag decision points
    with time windows.
  tech: Expedition-Python DLL · Expedition ensemble routing
  exp_features: Ensemble routing · Reverse isochrones · Sensitivity shading · Multiple optimal routes
  insight: >
    Will Oxley uses ensemble spread as primary decision tool.
    When routes cluster = commit. When routes diverge = hedge toward the middle.

  title: Automated Polar Validation & Refinement
  category: best-practice
  edge: 8.0
  complexity: 6
  status: planned
  description: >
    Parse Expedition race logs, compare actual BSP vs polar target across all
    TWA/TWS combinations. Identify consistent over/under-performance.
    Generate polar patch files automatically.
  tech: Python · Expedition logs · Polar parser · Stripchart data
  exp_features: Polar edit · Sail test analysis · Stripchart wand tests · Nav vs Performance polar
  insight: >
    Nick White (Expedition creator): "Your polars are an extremely valuable input.
    Garbage in = garbage out." Every top nav team does polar refinement after every race.
    Most J/99 teams don't.
  phase: Off-season project, updates before each race
  depends_on: []
  last_updated: 2026-02-27
  notes: Have 3 Expedition log files + v8 polar to start with.

  title: Strategic Sail Change Optimizer
  category: best-practice
  edge: 7.5
  complexity: 5
  status: planned
  description: >
    Combine routing output (predicted TWA/TWS along the course) with sail
    crossover chart to pre-plan every sail change. Calculate exact positions,
    account for doublehanded change time penalty.
  tech: Python · Expedition routing CSV export · Sailchart data
  exp_features: Sail chart · Optimal route results table · Sail polars
  insight: >
    On a J/99 doublehanded, a bad sail change costs 3-5 minutes. Knowing
    exactly when to change and pre-staging the right sail is worth more than
    most tactical decisions.
  phase: Pre-race (D-1) and during race
  depends_on: []
  last_updated: 2026-02-27
  notes: Have sailchart + crossover data in Excel from 2026 season.

  title: Pre-Race Historical Weather Analysis
  category: best-practice
  edge: 7.5
  complexity: 3
  status: planned
  description: >
    For a specific race course and date range, pull historical SMHI data
    to understand typical wind patterns, sea breeze timing, diurnal shifts.
    Build a "course weather playbook."
  tech: Python · SMHI historical API · Data visualization
  exp_features: Expedition weather display · Meteograms
  insight: >
    Stan Honey pre-analyzes years of historical data for every major race.
    The blur.se blog already shows SMHI historical work — this automates it.
  phase: Weeks before race, one-time per course

  title: Instrument Calibration Assistant
  category: best-practice
  edge: 7.0
  complexity: 5
  status: planned
  description: >
    Analyze Expedition logs to detect instrument calibration drift: compare
    TWD port vs starboard (upwash), BSP vs SOG (speed cal), current set
    changes tack-to-tack (heading cal).
  tech: Python · Expedition-Python DLL · Expedition logs
  exp_features: Calibration tables (TWA, TWS, BSP, Heading, Leeway) · Stripchart · B&G cal exchange
  insight: >
    Expedition docs: "If you have inaccurate data, then any calculations
    and decisions will reflect those errors." Bad cal = bad TWD = bad routing.
  phase: After every sail, continuous improvement

  title: Race Debrief Report Generator
  category: best-practice
  edge: 6.5
  complexity: 4
  status: planned
  description: >
    Auto-generate post-race analysis from Expedition logs: actual vs polar
    per leg, tactical decisions, model accuracy during race, and competitor
    analysis from YB/AIS data.
  tech: Python · Expedition logs · Claude AI for narrative
  exp_features: Log replay · Track display · AIS tracking · YB Tracking · Stripchart
  insight: >
    Every Volvo Ocean Race team does structured debriefs. Most club racers
    learn almost nothing between races because the data stays in a log file
    nobody opens.
  phase: Post-race (within 24h)

  title: Routing Sensitivity Time Budget
  category: best-practice
  edge: 8.0
  complexity: 4
  status: planned
  description: >
    Use Expedition's reverse isochrones and sensitivity shading to quantify
    WHERE time is won/lost on the course. Convert to a "time budget" per
    decision point.
  tech: Expedition-Python DLL · Expedition routing
  exp_features: Reverse isochrones · Sensitivity shading · Optimal route Polar% runs (90-110%)
  insight: >
    Expedition docs: "If forward and reverse isochrones are close together
    over a small distance, the optimal route is much more critical."
  phase: D-1 planning and during race

  title: Fleet Position & Competitor Tracker
  category: best-practice
  edge: 6.0
  complexity: 5
  status: planned
  description: >
    Ingest YB Tracking and AIS data for competitors. Calculate who's
    ahead/behind on corrected time (SRS handicap). Detect when competitors
    are on a different strategic option.
  tech: Python · YB Tracking API · AIS data · Expedition-Python DLL
  exp_features: YB Tracking · AIS target tracking · Fleet routing · "Ahead of" channel
  insight: >
    In Gotland Runt with 200 boats, knowing where your direct SRS competitors
    are is crucial for mid-race tactical adjustments.

  title: AI Weather Regime Classifier
  category: radical
  edge: 9.0
  complexity: 8
  status: idea
  description: >
    Train a classifier on historical Baltic weather to identify the current
    regime (frontal, gradient, thermal, post-frontal NW) and auto-select
    model weighting. "In frontal situations, trust ECMWF. In thermal
    patterns, trust ICON-EU."
  tech: Python · ML (scikit-learn/XGBoost) · SMHI historical · Open-Meteo archive
  exp_features: Ensemble routing weights based on regime
  insight: >
    No sailing team does this yet. Meteorologists know models have
    regime-dependent skill, but the connection to routing is manual and
    intuitive. This codifies what the best weather routers do by instinct.
  phase: Off-season R&D, long-term advantage
  depends_on: [1]
  last_updated: 2026-02-27
  notes: Requires large historical dataset. Could start with simple rule-based classifier before ML.

  title: Dynamic Polar Adjustment (Fatigue + Sea State)
  category: radical
  edge: 8.5
  complexity: 7
  status: idea
  description: >
    Your polar assumes peak performance. But doublehanded at 3 AM in 1.5m
    swell, you're not hitting 100%. Build a dynamic polar scaling model:
    time of day, sea state, hours into race, and recent BSP-vs-target ratio.
  tech: Python · Expedition-Python DLL · GRIB wave data · Expedition logs
  exp_features: Nav polar scaling · Polar% runs · Wave corrections · SetExpVar() for live polar %
  insight: >
    Expedition already has Polar% routing (90-110%). The radical part is
    making it DYNAMIC. No amateur team does this; some Volvo Ocean Race
    teams estimated crew fatigue manually.
  phase: Race day, automatic background process
  depends_on: [4]

  title: Probabilistic Routing with Confidence Intervals
  category: radical
  edge: 9.0
  complexity: 9
  status: idea
  description: >
    Instead of routing on one model, generate a probability distribution of
    arrival times via Monte Carlo. Output: "78% chance of arriving 14:00-16:00,
    but 15% chance of >20:00 if the front stalls."
  tech: Python · Monte Carlo simulation · Expedition routing via DLL · Scoring engine stats
  exp_features: Ensemble routing · Multiple optimal routes · Sensitivity shading
  insight: >
    This is what the ECMWF ensemble (51 members) is designed for, but
    nobody applies it to individual boat routing. You'd be the first J/99
    team doing probabilistic strategy.
  phase: D-2 to race, computationally intensive
  depends_on: [1, 2]

  title: Real-Time Land Effect Correction Model
  category: radical
  edge: 8.0
  complexity: 8
  status: idea
  description: >
    The Stockholm archipelago and Gotland's coastline create massive land
    effects no global model captures. Build a correction layer using
    historical SMHI station data for wind shadow, acceleration, thermal effects.
  tech: Python · SMHI multi-station analysis · GRIB modification · Spatial interpolation
  exp_features: GRIB weather display · Scale currents (analogous for wind patches)
  insight: >
    The 2019 blur.se blog noted ICON-EU and Météo-France differ by 9-16° in
    TWD near land — exactly this problem. The archipelago exit and Gotland's
    southern tip are notorious.
  phase: Course-specific R&D, applied during race
  depends_on: [6]

  title: Autonomous Expedition Co-Pilot (Pixel)
  category: radical
  edge: 9.5
  complexity: 10
  status: in-progress
  description: >
    A Python process connected to Expedition via DLL that acts as AI crew:
    monitors all instrument channels, detects wind shifts, triggers re-routing,
    manages sail change timing, watches competitors. The "always-on navigator"
    for doublehanded racing.
  tech: Python · Expedition-Python DLL (200+ channels) · Claude API · WebSocket to phone
  exp_features: Full DLL access · Alarms · SetSysBool for custom flags · What-if functionality
  insight: >
    This is the endgame — where all other projects converge. Every individual
    project becomes a module in this system. No doublehanded team has
    anything close.
  phase: Long-term vision, built incrementally
  depends_on: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10]
  last_updated: 2026-02-27
  notes: Pixel spec defined. This is the container — other projects are the modules.
